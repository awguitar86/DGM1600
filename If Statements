If statements are used to make decisions in code. First you set the variables with a data type and give it some data whether
it's a number or a word. Then in the code you can write if statements. If statements use relational operators. These are:
== is equal to
!= is not equal to
> is greater than
< is less than
>= is greater than or equal to
<= is less than or equal to
Here is an example of how to use these. 
Below is the code I wrote up for this assignment. I set income to 583.75 as a float value. And I set newcomputer to 1000 as
an integer value. In the code I wrote four if statements for income and newcomputer. I wrote an equal to if statement, and 
if it is true it will print out "Go ahead and buy it". If it is not true it will skip to the next line of code which is a 
not equal to if statement. If that if statement is true then it will print out "Sorry, no can buy." And it will keep going
the code going over each if statement and printing out what it says or going to the next line. 


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class IfStatement : MonoBehaviour {
	private float income = 583.75f;
	private int newcomputer = 1000;
	private int freezing = 32;
	private int outside = 32; 
	private string weather = "Cold";
	private bool awesome = true;
	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
		if (income == newcomputer) 
		{
			print (" Go ahead and buy it! ");
		}
		if (income != newcomputer) 
		{
			print (" Sorry, no can buy. ");
		}
		if (income < newcomputer)
		{
			print (" Stop being lazy and go earn some money! ");
		}
		if (income > newcomputer) 
		{
			print (" Good Job! Go get your new toy! ");
		}
		if (outside <= freezing)
		{
			print (" Welp, looks like I'm going to freeze my butt off today ");
		}
		if (outside >= freezing)
		{
			print (" Hey, today actually might be somewhat warm! ");
		}
		if (weather != "Cold") 
		{
			print (" Doesn't look like you have to wear a jacket today! ");
		}
		if (weather == "Cold") 
		{
			print (" Yeah, your going to have to wear a jacket and a beanie today. ");
		}
		if (awesome == true)
		{
			print (" Yeah you are awesome!! ");
			awesome = false;
		}
		if (awesome == false)
		{
			print (" Stay in bed all day and binge watch Netflix. ");
		}
	}
}
