This was a challenge for me, but with the help of a classmate and my dad I was able to figure it out. I still don't fully 
understand why and how this works, but it works!

  
public class whileloop : MonoBehaviour {
private int lowNum = 1;
private int highNum = 100;
private int randomNum;
private int counter = 0;
private int target = 77;

// Use this for initialization
void Start ()
{
	while (randomNum != target) 
	{
		randomNum = Random.Range (lowNum, highNum);

		if (randomNum > 77) 
		{
			highNum = randomNum;
		} 
		else if (randomNum < 77) 
		{
			lowNum = randomNum;
		}

		counter++;

		if (randomNum == target) 
		{
			print ("Attempt " + counter + ": Congratulations! " + randomNum + " is the right number! ");
			break;
		} 
		else
			print ("Attempt " + counter + ": Sorry " + randomNum + " is not the right number. ");
	}
}
}
