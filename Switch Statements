If and if/else statments are similar to switches, but there is a difference. Switches only use equal to. They don't do greater
than or less than. If/else statements do the greater than and less than stuff, because they have multiple decisions to 
be made. Switches are equal to one thing at a time, depending on what the variables are assigned to. For example, in the code
below, the temperature variable is assigned to 40 degrees. Then below in the code there are different temperature cases,
and if the temperature is set to any of those it will print out the phrase for tht temperature. If not it will go right to the
default and print out that phrase. Between each statement there has to be a break so that it will break out of that statement
and go onto the next statement. Switches are sometimes more usful and easier to read than if/else statements because of how 
simple they are.
