The math operations are fairly easy to underdtand for myself. It's basically math equations and the data for the equations are
assigned to variables and certain data types depending on the number. Then the variables are put into place for the numbers in 
the equation. By doing this the variables can be used in multiple equations and operations. 

I've copied the code I wrote for the assignment here as a reference. Starting with the variables I created, the float data type
is used for pi and radius because they are both decimals. Then I used the int data type for the other variable, because they
are all whole numbers. 

The statements are each an equation written out using the variables in place of the numbers, because the variables have been
assigned the numbers which make them the same as the numbers. On some of the equations, like on finding the area of a circle,
the radius was squared. I didn't know how to square something in code. So, I put the radius times itself inside parenthesis 
which makes it solved first before multiplying by pi. 

The print value is used to spit out the answer of the equation in the console. In the print value I said what the answer to the
equation was with the variable of each equation. For example, "The diamter of the circle with radius " +radius " is " + diamter);
