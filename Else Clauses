Else clauses help to be more specific in if statements. Instead of having a bunch of if statements with many of them that 
run, you can use else and else-if statments to be more specific and only run one block of code. 

For example, in this line of code instead of doing two if statements and having it print wake up and go to sleep right after,
it will now only print one of them because of the else clause. These lines of code with print Wake Up because awake is set
to false. 

private bool awake = false;

    if (awake == false) 
		{
			print ("WAKE UP!");
			awake = true;
		} 

		else 
		{
			print ("Go to sleep");
		}
    
An example of using else-if statements is these line of code. Else-if statments can be used to help narrow down even more of
a decision with a condition. These lines of code are saying if the time is less than 12 then print good morning. If it is 
equal to then print Lunch Time. If it is less than 18 then print Good afternoon. And if it is none of those then run Good
Evening. The else clause is always the very last in the lines of code, and there can only be one. The there can be lots of 
else-if statements if need be.

private int time = 14;

    if (time < 12) 
    {
			print ("Good Morning!");
		} 
		else if (time == 12) 
    {
			print ("Lunch Time");
		} 
		else if (time < 18) 
		{
			print ("Good Afternoon!");
		}
		else 
		{
			print ("Good Evening");
		}

Here is another example of else-if statements. The grade is set to 87. So if the grade is greater than 90 it prints out A.
And then it says if it is not greater than 90 then go onto the next line of code which says if the grade is greater than 
80 then print out a B. And there can be multiple else-if statements for each grade. 

private float grade = 87;
    if (grade > 90) 
    {
			print ("A");
		} 
    else if (grade > 80) 
		{
			print ("B");	
		}
    
Another example of the else clause is this line of code. It won't print both statements, because of the else clause. 

private float tempurature = 50;

     if (temperature > 50)
     {
        print ("It's going ot be very nice today!");
     }
     else
     {
        print ("It might be a bit chilly today. Where a jacket.");
     }
